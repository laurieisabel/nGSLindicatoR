#' @param codeqc the numerical code used in Quebec region for a species. 792 is unspeciated redfish. Look at the "species"
#'         table (codeqc) for other species
#' @param PPWR the mean predator/prey weight ratio. If 10, then the predator on average weighs 10x more than its prey
#' @param PPWR.cv the coefficient of variation of the predator prey weight ratio
#' @param minPPWR the minimum predator/prey weight ratio allowed. e.g. if 3 then the prey is never allowed to be more than 1/3 of the
#'         predator weight
#' @param QWb the exponent of the allometric relationship describing food consumption rate as a function of a fish's weight
#' @description The predator-prey weight ratio is modelled as a log-normal distribution. The energy demand of a predator is a
#'         function of the predator size. This is not actually the amount of predation that has occured but a predation risk or
#'         preference, i.e. given the size distribution of predators in the system, the PSS shows where they would most like to
#'         take their prey. Since the index is relative, a QWa parameter is not needed as it is just a scaling parameter.
#'
#'         The PPWR CV 0.25 is from from Hahm and Langton (1984). Their PPWR is likely too large for predators in the Northern
#'         Gulf which are eating other fish and large invertebrates such as shrimp. Our default value is 30 which means that a
#'         predator is 30 times larger its prey (by weight) on average.
#'
#'         The log normal density function will produce NaNs for some size ranges and warnings will be produced. This is generally
#'         nothing to worry about as NaNs are converted to 0. The warnings have not be suppressed, however.
#' @return A list is returned: element 1: the year vector; element 2: the prey length vector; element 3: the prey weight vector;
#'         element 4: a matrix of the predation pressure over all prey sizes (rows) by year (columns). You will likely work with
#'         element 1 and 4 for plotting or creation of predation indices on particular prey size classes. The values in the matrix are
#'         not scaled but this can be done easily by dividing the matrix by the maximum value of the matrix. They can be scaled annually
#'         using the apply function and dividing each value in a column (year) by the maximum in that column. The whole PSS is normalised
#'         by dividing by the maximum value.
#' @example
#'         pss.out= PSS.f("all")
#'         pss.scaled= pss.out$pred.risk/max(pss.out$pred.risk)
#'         plot(pss.out$year, pss.scaled[10,],type="l") #the time series of predation risk on prey size 10cm
